## UML class diagram for cardiovascular data generator

The [UML class diagram](uml_class_cardio_generator.pdf) for the cardio generator represents the inner structure between all the classes. The three main classes and interfaces are: HealthDataSimulator, OutputStrategy and PatientDataGenerator. The latter two are interfaces where the implementation of their methods is undefined.

To keep the diagram readable, there are no parameters included in private methods.
Furthermore, any method that is inherited or overwritten does also not contain parameters as those are the same as the parent class/interface.
